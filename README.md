## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate property prices based on features such as location, size, and amenities. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objectives
- To build and train machine learning models to predict real estate prices.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify key features.
- To compare different machine learning models and select the best performing one.
- To provide insights into the factors influencing property prices.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about real estate properties and their sale prices. It consists of the following key features:
- **Location**: City, Neighborhood
- **Property Size**: Square Feet
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Property Type**: Apartment, Villa, etc.
- **Age of Property**
- **Amenities**: Pool, Garage, Garden, etc.
- **Proximity**: Distance to schools, malls, and public transport

**Source**: The dataset can be obtained from [link to dataset] or provided upon request.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed or removed missing values in critical columns.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables encoded using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numeric features to ensure consistent scale.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled outliers to improve model accuracy.

## Modeling
We implemented and evaluated several machine learning models:
1. **Linear Regression**: A baseline model to predict prices.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships.
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method to improve performance.
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Boosted decision tree model for higher accuracy.
5. **XGBoost Regressor**: Optimized gradient boosting model.

### Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- **Train-Test Split**: Data was split into training and testing sets.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to ensure model robustness.
- **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.

## Results
- **Best Model**: The **XGBoost Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy with a high R-squared score and low MAE/MSE.
- **Key Features**: Size of the property, location, and number of amenities were significant predictors of price.
- **Insights**: Properties in prime locations and with more amenities typically had higher prices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data processing and modeling.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for developing and documenting the project.
- **Google Colab**: For running and sharing notebooks online.
